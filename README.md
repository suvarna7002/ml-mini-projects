## 📌 Project 1: Linear Regression from Scratch (using NumPy)

### 🔍 Description
This project demonstrates a simple linear regression model built **without using any ML libraries**. It uses:

- Python + NumPy
- Batch Gradient Descent
- Custom Cost and Gradient Functions

### 📊 Dataset
A salary dataset with the columns:
- `YearsExperience`
- `Salary`

> 💾 [Download the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhishek14398/salary-dataset-simple-linear-regression)

### ⚙️ Features
- Load and visualize data using Matplotlib
- Implement cost function and gradient descent manually
- Train the model to find optimal weights
- Predict salaries and visualize the regression line

### ✅ Result
The model successfully learns a linear relationship between years of experience and salary, and performs well on this dataset.
